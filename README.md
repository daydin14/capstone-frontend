### What is React Native?
___
React Native is a JavaScript Framework for writing mobile applications for iOS and Android development. Similar to React, Native applications are comprised of primarily JavaScript and XML-esque markup (JSX). Its core set of platform components include but are not limited to: View, Text, Image. 


### Application Details
___
Project Cap is my Capstone and final project with General Assembly. Our task was to break through our comfort zone and learn a completely new technology. We were given the chance to choose amongst core modules or to create an entirely new project with new technology different from the modules. <strong>React-Native</strong> is the new technology I chose to learn and create with a tight schedule of approximately a week. Project Cap's main goal was to mimic our Dev Skills Lab of adding skills to an appending list that updates on the screen. This application not only allows a user to add but delete an instanstance or skill from the list. To start a react-native application, Expo CLI (Command Line Interface) must be installed to initialize an appliction with Expo. The initialization process includes creating the base files for our react-native application.

### Future Enhancement
___
Include Firebase for Authentication <br/>
Connection a Database with Backend Code <br/>
Deploy onto App Store or Google Play Store <br/>

### Instructions
___
To run this application after cloning my repository, cd (change directory) into the CapstoneApp folder. <br/>
Once you're inside the CapstoneApp folder, run the command: "npm start". This will run its on chain of commands from Expo. <br/>
Next we press "i" within the terminal after the message: "Started Metro Bundler". <br/>
This will run an iPhone simulator on mac and open your application with an expo application on the simulator. <br/>

Note React-Native supports both iOS and Android. The process of running React-Native includes using Android SDK.
