### What is React Native?
___
React Native is a JavaScript Framework for writing mobile applications for iOS and Android development. Similar to React, Native applications are comprised of primarily JavaScript and XML-esque markup (JSX). Its core set of platform components include but are not limited to: View, Text, Image. 


### Application Details
___
Project Cap is my Capstone and final project with General Assembly. Our task was to break through our comfort zone and learn a completely new technology. We were given the chance to choose amongst core modules or to create an entirely new project with new technology different from the modules. <strong>React-Native</strong> is the new technology I chose to learn and create with a tight schedule of approximately a week. Project Cap's main goal was to mimic our Dev Skills Lab of adding skills to an appending list that updates on the screen. This application not only allows a user to add but delete an instanstance or skill from the list.
